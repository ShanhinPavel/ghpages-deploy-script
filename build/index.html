    <h2>GitHub Pages HTML Site Deploy Script for CircleCI</h2>
    <p>A test and demo project of a script that will deploy a static HTML site to GitHub Pages on commit.</p>
    <p>This is the site that has been deployed.</p>
    <p>The Git repository to deploy this site can be found at
      <a href="https://github.com/eldarlabs/ghpages-deploy-script">https://github.com/eldarlabs/ghpages-deploy-script</a></p>
    <p>It is a test repository to trigger the recration of the  <a href="https://github.com/eldarlabs/cycle-ui">Cycle-UI</a> demo website.
    <p>Cool. It worked first time. Now let's see if this updates after a commit to index.html</p>
    <p>Sweet, the commit worked. Now let's see if we can trigger it from CircleCI.<p>
    <p>After some reworking, I think CircleCI triggers should now rebuild gh-pages correctly</p>
    <p>Added GitHub environment variables to CircleCI</p>
    <p>Wow, that was a lot of messing around! I ended up making a GitHub machine user to get write access to the repo.</p>
